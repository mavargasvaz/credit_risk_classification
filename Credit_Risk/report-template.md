## Overview of the Analysis

In this section, describe the analysis you completed for the machine learning models used in this Challenge. This might include:

* A Model that Predicts if a loan is going to be a low risk or a high risk loan
* Our Dataset for this excersice give us a basic features of the loans from this bank.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* We applied a Train / Test model to split the data, then we applied Logistic Regression
* Logistic Regression from sklearn and imblearn for resample the data.

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
      Balanced Accuracy: 95.2%
      High Risk Precison: 85%
      Low Risk Precision: 100%
      High Risk Recall : 91%
      Low Risk Recall:  99 %
  
* Machine Learning Model 2:
  *   Balanced Accuracy: 99.3%
      High Risk Precison: 84%
      Low Risk Precision: 99%
      High Risk Recall : 99%
      Low Risk Recall:  99 %

## Summary

* We can observe that both models are very reliable

* The performance for both models , I believe it is because we are talking about financial information and we can expect very good results, if we have more true for the high risk loans and we dot not add more variables to the data set, I think that we can achieve 99% for the high risk loans also.

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
